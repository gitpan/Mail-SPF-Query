Mail/SPF/Query version 1.2
===========================

The SPF protocol relies on sender domains to publish a DNS
whitelist of their designated outbound mailers.  Given an
envelope sender, Mail::SPF::Query determines the legitimacy
of an SMTP client IP.

   pass     (client localhost[1.2.3.4] is designated mailer for domain of sender myname@myhost.mydomain.com)
   error    (temporary failure while resolving designated mailer status for domain of sender myname@myhost.mydomain.com)
   unknown  (domain of sender myname@myhost.mydomain.com does not designate mailers)
   fail     (client localhost[1.2.3.4] is not a designated mailer for domain of sender myname@myhost.mydomain.com)
   softfail (client localhost[1.2.3.4] is not a designated mailer for transitioning domain of sender myname@myhost.mydomain.com)
